`master` is the current working version that is compatible with `api` version
running on `gissurvey-test.trimet.org`


`trimet_working` branch contains working implementation that will work with
the head of master `api` repo.


`vector` is continuation of `trimet_working` that will be a re-write
using MapBox vector tiles instead of raster.
